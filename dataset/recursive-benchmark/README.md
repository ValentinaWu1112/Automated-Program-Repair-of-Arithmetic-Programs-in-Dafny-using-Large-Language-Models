# Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into two main directories:

1. **Correct_Code**: This directory contains Dafny code that has been successfully translated and verified

2. **Fault_Code**: This directory contains Dafny code with mutation bugs. Each buggy line is highlighted with the comment `//buggy line` at the original line where the bug occurs.
