 The buggy line is marked with the comment "//buggy line". It appears to be missing a semicolon at the end of the line that creates a new Cell object. Here's the corrected line:
```
ghost var repr := Repr - {this} - {c, d}; //buggy line
```
becomes:
```
ghost var repr := Repr - {this} - {new Cell(0), new Cell(0)};
```
